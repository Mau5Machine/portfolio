This is my first repository with github, I am currently building a portfolio website for myself. The goal is to make it responsive and clean. I am practicing CSS, Js, and HTML in this repo. My objectives are....

1. Create Mobile first
2. Use Js and jQuery to manipulate elements on the DOM
3. Create a sleek and professional page to show to possible employers
4. Include sub sections with information about me, projects, contact information, and blog

I'm starting a code school on the 17th of July and I am going to be learning a full stack so as time progresses, you will see this site improve a lot.

Stay tuned on my journey!
